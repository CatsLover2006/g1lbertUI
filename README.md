# g1lbertUI
## A GUI for g1lbertJB
Go check out https://github.com/g1lbertJB/g1lbertJB for the actual jailbreak, this is just a fancy coat of paint.
## How to use
Compile the JAR file, copy it into the current g1lbertJB release folder, run it. I've still got to figure out Linux architecture detection.
## TODO
- Get a log of a successful jailbreak, so I can actually implement the main log part instead of just errors.
- Linux support (shouldn't be that hard, right?)

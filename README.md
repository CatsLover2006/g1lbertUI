# g1lbertUI
## A GUI for g1lbertJB
Go check out https://github.com/g1lbertJB/g1lbertJB for the actual jailbreak, this is just a fancy coat of paint.
## How to use
Compile the JAR file, copy it into the current g1lbertJB release folder, run the JAR file. As of version 1.0.4, there's a bug relating to the way my Java code and the original jailbreak interact, I've made a pull request fixing it.
## TODO
- Get more people to use it, because I've got a sample size of 1 device jailbroken using this tool (I've got nothing else to jailbreak with this)

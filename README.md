# g1lbertUI
## A GUI for g1lbertJB
Go check out https://github.com/g1lbertJB/g1lbertJB for the actual jailbreak, this is just a fancy coat of paint.
## How to use
Copy the JAR file for the current version (compiled or from the releases) into the current g1lbertJB release folder, and run the JAR file. As of version 1.0.4, there's a bug relating to the way my Java code and the original jailbreak interact, I've made a pull request fixing it.
## TODO
- Get more people to use it, because I've got a sample size of 2 devices jailbroken using this tool
